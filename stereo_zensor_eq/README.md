Front channels have room-correction.

Centre channel is plugged into the stereo subwoofer-centre. Centre is duplicated into C1 and CLOW

C1 is the high-pass that goes to the centre. C1 is duplicated and its signal is sent through both Centre and Sub outputs because the Alans is a stereo speaker.

CLOW has a low-pass filter and is merged into the sub line.

The centre channel's crossover is at 120Hz

The sub line is merged into L and R, which have a subwoofer attached.

The rear pair is untouched, except for a high-pass filter at 100 Hz.
